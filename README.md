# Enhanced Mushrooms

A Team Aurora mod. Join our discord at https://discord.gg/BgE4EpP.

Minecraft 1.16's new wood types are new nether mushrooms. Enhanced Mushrooms aims to add consistency by making red and brown mushrooms also work as wood types.

The mod also adds Roasted Mushrooms, a new food source from mushrooms that does not require a bowl!

This mod also is compatible with some of Quark's features. If Quark is installed, glowshrooms are added as another new (and transparent) wood type, and each new wood type has its own unique bookshelf and ladder, as well as vertical slabs and planks. Quark chest variant compat and Buzzier Bees beehive compat is planned but not yet implemented.
